# Omics Data Analysis- Introduction to BioConductor (Classes)

This repository is intended to provide a soft introduction to Bioconductor classes for managing microarrays and similar data.

It is based on the vignettes() of two packages `ExpressionSet` and `geoQuery` which can be accessed, after loading each package with the instruction `openVignette()`.

There are two ways to use the repository

- Download or clone the repository, so you can access directly to all files and re-create the document if you wisht to.
- Access directly to the output in [this link](https://aspteaching.github.io/Omics_Data_Analysis-Case_Study_0-Introduction_to_BioC/Introduction_2_Bioc_classes_4_microarrays.html)
