# Omics Data Analysis- Introduction to BioConductor (Classes)

This repository is intended to provide a soft introduction to Bioconductor classes for managing microarrays and similar data.

It is based on the vignettes() of two packages `ExpressionSet` and `geoQuery` which can be accessed, after loading each package with the instruction `openVignette()`.
